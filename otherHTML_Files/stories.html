                To me, travel isn’t only about relaxing or being on a holiday; it’s also about venturing out into the
                unknown, following your own path, and pushing beyond your comfort zone.
                <!-- It means trying new food,
                experiencing other cultures, and doing silly things sometimes. At its best, travel lets you view the

                with a sense of awe and wonder.My mission is to share honest and inspiring travel guides that will help
                you
                get out there and explore. -->

            <h1>My First Solo</h1>
            <p>
                Trip
                These days I feel like I can drop myself into any travel situation and figure things out. But that was
                definitely not the case on my first major trip!I did my first-ever solo trip to another continent at the
                ripe old age of… 17. I’m from The Netherland and had planned a trip to California — a world away from my
                comfort zone.I was too excited to even sleep on my flight. My nose just became permanently glued to the
                airplane window. Honestly, my first few days on the trip I was a nervous wreck. I was staying in a
                hostel in the sketchiest neighborhood ever and I felt 100% in over my head… but I found my footing, had
                a great experience (eventually) and lived to tell the tale. It planted the seed for future trips, both
                with friends and on my own.I did some great trips in Europe in the years that followed, but what I
                really had my mind set on was breaking into the game industry. Oddly, this is what got me into
                travelling a lot more…

                Travelling for…
                video games?
                In 2008 I moved to Brighton, UK to work at a video game studio. In 2009, I became Head of Content at the
                European arm of video game publisher SEGA in London. (It’s the company that makes Sonic the Hedgehog.) I
                still find it kind of crazy that I became a video game executive at age 27, but I guess I was in the
                right place at the right time.
                What does this have to do with travel?
                Well, I was tasked with checking up on games in development to make sure they were delivering on their
                potential. If not, I had to meet with the game developers, who were located all over the world. (“All
                over the world?!?”, I do remember thinking during my job interview.)
                Literally in my first week at SEGA, having not yet met my boss in person and just barely after I’d
                figured out how the coffee machine worked, I was already being sent on a round-the-world trip.
                I had to pack my bags right away to head off on a trip to Japan, Australia, the US and back to the UK. I
                could hardly believe it!
                Feeling somewhat overwhelmed, I wondered if I’d make it through probation at all, but I figured at least
                I’d have at least done an amazing trip across three continents. It wasn’t exactly travel for fun, but of
                course I was relishing the opportunity anyway.
                I spent the next few weeks living out of hotels. I had meetings during the week but my evenings and
                weekends were completely free to explore.
                Visiting Tokyo for the first time was beyond surreal. I was alone in Tokyo with nothing to lose… somehow
                I made several expat friends, ended up at a Japanese Reggae band’s album release party, sang karaoke
                well into the night, sat at the top floor of the Park Hyatt having whiskeys with the jazz band singer,
                and simply wandered aimlessly in a strange city while listening to the Lost in Translation soundtrack —
                a film that hugely mirrored my experience in Tokyo.
                I kept travelling a lot for work (and for fun in my free time). My visits to Japan in particular made me
                determined to travel properly around Asia someday.
                Sure, they were work trips, but it was unbelievably cool to be able to sample so many places around the
                world, have a lot of my expenses covered, and rack up airmiles in the process.
                This would all come in handy when… I ended up abandoning my career forever.

                    Having experienced the best time in my life, I wanted to help other travellers get into the

                    years… it’s been a pretty crazy ride. I hope you’ll find the independent travel guides here useful

                <p>
                    Traveling in mountainous areas, gear requirements vary by activity. For hiking, you'll need sturdy
                    boots, weather-appropriate clothing, a backpack with essentials, trekking poles, sun protection, and
                    navigation tools. For biking, a mountain bike, helmet, repair kit, water, maps, and protective gear
                    are essential. When driving, ensure a reliable vehicle, spare tires, an emergency kit, navigation
                    tools, suitable clothing, and extra supplies. If camping, bring a tent, sleeping gear, cooking
                    equipment, bear-resistant food containers, clothing for cold nights, lighting, and navigation tools.
                    Adapt your gear to the season, altitude, and terrain, and prioritize safety in mountainous
                    environments. Gear needs may vary based on season, altitude, and terrain. Prioritize safety and
                    thorough preparation when exploring mountainous regions to ensure a memorable and secure adventure.
